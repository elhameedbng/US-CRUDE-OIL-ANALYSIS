Crude oil is a naturally occurring, unrefined petroleum product composed of hydrocarbon deposits and other organic materials. It is a fossil fuel that is refined to produce usable products such as gasoline, diesel, and various forms of petrochemicals. The United States imports crude oil from various countries to supplement its domestic production. This analysis on thisimportant as it not only enable us to understand trend, patterns and behaviour of the supply, but also le stakeholders to understand the source of pollution, identify countrues with better environmentally friendly crude oil, help make budget, and to also make forecast on the price of crude oil in years to come. In this notebook, I will analyze the data across different regions and countries over the years to gain insights into their trends and behaviour. The analysis would also help the US government to make informed-decisons. finally, I will use this data to make future forecast of the quantity of crude oil.
